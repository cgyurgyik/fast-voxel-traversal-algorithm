### About
A prototype for the implementation of Amanatides & Woo's "A Fast Voxel Traversal Algorithm" in C++. Note, this has not been tested, and is not guaranteed to be bug-free. An overview of the algorithm can be found [here](https://github.com/cgyurgyik/fast-voxel-traversal-algorithm/blob/master/overview/FastVoxelTraversalOverview.md).

### Notes
- Instead of using ```double``` or ```float```, I've decided to use ```value_type``` which can be set to a user-specified type in ```Vec3.h```.
- An optional enhancement that can be done is calculating the ray's inverse direction upon construction of the ray. This will ensure inverse direction is calculated only once per ray.
